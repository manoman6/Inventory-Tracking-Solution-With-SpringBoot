Tasked with modernizing a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and HTML user interface, this solution 
created inventory managing and tracking. With the ability to log new parts, made both in-house and by a third-party. 
Utilizing SpringBoot with a Model View Controller design pattern, new parts and products can be added, logged, built, 
deleted and sold while maintaining accurate inventory.
